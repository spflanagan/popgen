Usage: python Make_Plots.py

This is meant to be a general use script to fit a demographic model and create
plots of the data and model sfs. The user will have to edit information about
their allele frequency spectrum and provide a custom model. The instructions
are annotated below, with a #************** marking sections that will have to
be edited.

This script must be in the same working directory as Plotting_Functions.py, which
contains all the functions necessary for generating simulations and optimizing the model.

General workflow:
 The user provides a model and the previously optimized parameters for their empirical 
 data. The model is fit using these parameters, and the resulting model SFS is used to
 create the plot comparing the data to the model. 
 
Outputs:
 A summary file of the model fit will be created, along with a pdf of the plot.
 
Notes/Caveats:
 Sometimes you may see the following error when plotting 2D or 3D:
 
 "ValueError: Data has no positive values, and therefore can not be log-scaled."
 
 To deal with this, you can change the optional argument vmin_val to a value
 between 0 and 0.05 (0.05 is the default). I have used values from 0.005-0.01
 with good visual results.
