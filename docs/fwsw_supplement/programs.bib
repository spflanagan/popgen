	abstract = {The advent of modern {DNA} sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing whole-genome data. We present {SweeD} (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used {SweepFinder} program. The sequential version of {SweeD} is up to 22 times faster than {SweepFinder} and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of {SweeD} for multi-core processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to deploy {SweeD} on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well as to resume long-running analyses after processor failures. In addition, the user can specify various demographic models via the command-line to calculate their theoretically expected site frequency spectra. Therefore, (in contrast to {SweepFinder}) the neutral site frequencies can optionally be directly calculated from a given demographic model. We show that an increase of sample size results in more precise detection of positive selection. Thus, the ability to analyze substantially larger sample sizes by using {SweeD} leads to more accurate sweep detection. We validate {SweeD} via simulations and by scanning the first chromosome from the 1000 human Genomes project for selective sweeps. We compare {SweeD} results with results from a linkage-disequilibrium-based approach and identify common outliers.},

Because Pool-Seq provides genome-wide {SNP} frequency data, it is possible to use them for demographic inference and/or the identification of selective sweeps. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is designed to detect selective sweeps from pooled data by accounting for statistical challenges associated with Pool-Seq, namely sequencing errors and random sampling among chromosomes. This allows for an efficient use of the information: all base calls are included in the analysis, but the higher credibility of regions with higher coverage and base calls with better quality scores is accounted for. Computer simulations show that our method efficiently detects sweeps even at very low coverage (0.5x per chromosome). Indeed, the power of detecting sweeps is similar to what we could expect from sequences of individual chromosomes. Since the inference of selective sweeps is based on the allele frequency spectrum ({AFS}), we also provide a method to accurately estimate the {AFS} provided that the quality scores for the sequence reads are reliable. Applying our approach to Pool-Seq data from Drosophila melanogaster, we identify several selective sweep signatures on chromosome X that include some previously well-characterized sweeps like the wapl region.},

I present the r package sequoia, which assigns parents, clusters half-siblings sharing an unsampled parent and assigns grandparents to half-sibships. Assignments are made after consideration of the likelihoods of all possible first-, second- and third-degree relationships between the focal individuals, as well as the traditional alternative of being unrelated. This careful exploration of the local likelihood surface is implemented in a fast, heuristic hill-climbing algorithm. Distinction between the various categories of second-degree relatives is possible when likelihoods are calculated conditional on at least one parent of each focal individual. Performance was tested on simulated data sets with realistic genotyping error rate and missingness, based on three different large pedigrees (N = 1000?2000). This included a complex pedigree with overlapping generations, occasional close inbreeding and some unknown birth years. Parentage assignment was highly accurate down to about 100 independent {SNPs} (error rate {\textless}0.1\%) and fast ({\textless}1 min) as most pairs can be excluded from being parent?offspring based on opposite homozygosity. For full pedigree reconstruction, 40\% of parents were assumed nongenotyped.

	abstract = {Author Summary Eukaryotic genomes range from millions to billions of base pairs in size, but for many genetic experiments it is sufficient to gather information from just a fraction of these sites. In practice, selecting a consistent set of sites can be achieved by cutting genomic {DNA} with enzymes that recognize {DNA} sequence motifs, and then sequencing the ends of the resulting fragments. The advantages of this well-known approach are its low cost relative to whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) and that it does not require a sequenced genome. These methods, for example genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}), are popular for mapping genes and studying population genetics, particularly in non-model organisms. Here we demonstrate, however, that computational tools designed for {WGS} are insufficient for handling certain error types that arise in {GBS} and other similar methods. We present a modified protocol for {GBS} and a statistical method for detecting these errors, implemented in the software package {GBStools}. We tested our methods on human {DNA} samples from Argentine populations.

Existing methods can achieve these ends, but they require additional information in the form of demographic data, thousands of markers and/or estimates of genotyping error rates. For many non-model systems, it is simply not practical, cost-effective or logistically feasible to obtain this information. Here, we develop a Bayesian parentage method that only requires the sampled genotypes to account for genotyping error, missing data and false matches. Results: Extensive testing with microsatellite and {SNP} datasets reveals that our Bayesian parentage method reliably controls for the number of false assignments, irrespective of the genotyping error rate. When the number of loci is limiting, our approach maximizes the number of correct assignments by accounting for the frequencies of shared alleles. Comparisons with exclusion and likelihood-based methods on an empirical salmon dataset revealed that our Bayesian method had the highest ratio of correct to incorrect assignments.

Nevertheless, single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are becoming increasing popular in many areas of molecular ecology, owing to their high-throughput, easy transferability between laboratories and low genotyping error. An ongoing discussion concerns the relative power of {SNPs} compared to microsatellites—that is, how many {SNP} loci are needed to replace a panel of microsatellites? Here, we evaluate the assignment power of 80 {SNPs} ({HE} = 0.30, 80 independent alleles) and 11 microsatellites ({HE} = 0.85, 192 independent alleles) in a wild population of about 400 sockeye salmon with two commonly used software packages (Cervus3, Colony2) and, for {SNPs} only, a newly developed software ({SNPPIT}). Assignment success was higher for {SNPs} than for microsatellites, especially for parent pairs, irrespective of the method used. Colony2 assigned a larger proportion of offspring to at least one parent than the other methods, although Cervus and {SNPPIT} detected more parent pairs. Identification of full-sib groups without parental information from relatedness measures was possible using both marker systems, although explicit reconstruction of such groups in Colony2 was impossible for {SNPs} because of computation time. Our results confirm the applicability of {SNPs} for parentage analyses and refute the predictability of assignment success from the number of independent alleles.},

In order to address this issue, we developed {SNPassoc}, an R package to carry out most common analyses in whole genome association studies. These analyses include descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis of missing values, calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, analysis of association based on generalized linear models (either for quantitative or binary traits), and analysis of multiple {SNPs} (haplotype and epistasis analysis).},

Molecular markers allow inference of pedigrees in wild species where relationship information is impossible to collect by observation. Marker data are analysed statistically using methods based on Mendelian inheritance rules. There are numerous computer programs available to conduct pedigree analysis, but most software is inflexible, both in terms of assumptions and data requirements. Most methods only accommodate monogamous diploid species using codominant markers without genotyping error. In addition, most commonly used methods use pairwise comparisons rather than a full-pedigree likelihood approach, which considers the likelihood of the entire pedigree structure and allows the simultaneous inference of parentage and sibship. Here, we describe colony, a computer program implementing full-pedigree likelihood methods to simultaneously infer sibship and parentage among individuals using multilocus genotype data. colony can be used for both diploid and haplodiploid species; it can use dominant and codominant markers, and can accommodate, and estimate, genotyping error at each locus. In addition, colony can carry out these inferences for both monoecious and dioecious species. The program is available as a Microsoft Windows version, which includes a graphical user interface, and a Macintosh version, which uses an R-based interface.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Heritabilities, commonly used to predict evolutionary potential, are notoriously low for behaviors. Apart from strong contributions of environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of courtship traits in founder\&\#x2010;flush and control populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each male and female display through the regression of the courtships involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the \&\#x201c;midparental\&\#x201d; courtship values of their parents. Overall, the average heritability was significantly ( {\textbackslash}documentclass\{aastex\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsbsy\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{bm\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{mathrsfs\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{pifont\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{stmaryrd\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{textcomp\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{portland,xspace\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath,amsxtra\} {\textbackslash}usepackage[{OT}2,{OT}1]\{fontenc\} {\textbackslash}newcommand{\textbackslash}cyr\{ {\textbackslash}renewcommand{\textbackslash}rmdefault\{wncyr\} {\textbackslash}renewcommand{\textbackslash}sfdefault\{wncyss\} {\textbackslash}renewcommand{\textbackslash}encodingdefault\{{OT}2\} {\textbackslash}normalfont {\textbackslash}selectfont\} {\textbackslash}{DeclareTextFontCommand}\{{\textbackslash}textcyr\}\{{\textbackslash}cyr\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}{DeclareMathSizes}\{10\}\{9\}\{7\}\{6\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}landscape \$P=.012\$ {\textbackslash}end\{document\} ) higher for the parent\&\#x2010;daughter assays than for the parent\&\#x2010;son assays. We attributed the low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype\&\#x2010;by\&\#x2010;environment interactions whereby the male\&\#x2019;s behavior is influenced by the \&\#x201c;environment\&\#x201d; of his mating partner\&\#x2019;s preferences for the display, generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover, bottlenecked lines had up to 800\% of the heritability of the controls, suggesting \&\#x201c;conversion\&\#x201d; of additive genetic variance from nonadditive components. Second, we used line\&\#x2010;cross assays on separate populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of 0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64\% of the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.},

Methodology is well established for diploid species, and several software packages exist for elucidating paternity in diploids; however, these issues are not so readily addressed in polyploids due to the increased complexity of the exclusion problem and a lack of available software. We introduce polypatex, an r package for paternity exclusion analysis using microsatellite data in autopolyploid, monoecious or dioecious/bisexual species with a ploidy of 4n, 6n or 8n. Given marker data for a set of offspring, their mothers and a set of candidate fathers, polypatex uses allele matching to exclude candidates whose marker alleles are incompatible with the alleles in each offspring?mother pair. polypatex can analyse marker data sets in which allele copy numbers are known (genotype data) or unknown (allelic phenotype data) ? for data sets in which allele copy numbers are unknown, comparisons are made taking into account all possible genotypes that could arise from the compared allele sets. polypatex is a software tool that provides population geneticists with the ability to investigate the mating patterns of autopolyploids using paternity exclusion analysis on data from codominant markers having multiple alleles per locus.},

We present ddradseqtools, a software package to help {ddRADseq} experimental design by (i) the generation of in silico double-digested fragments; (ii) the construction of modified {ddRADseq} libraries using adapters with either one or two indexes and degenerate base regions ({DBRs}) to quantify {PCR} duplicates; and (iii) the initial steps of the bioinformatics preprocessing of reads. ddradseqtools generates single-end ({SE}) or paired-end ({PE}) reads that may bear {SNPs} and/or indels. The effect of allele dropout and {PCR} duplicates on coverage is also simulated. The resulting output files can be submitted to pipelines of alignment and variant calling, to allow the fine-tuning of parameters. The software was validated with specific tests for the correct operability of the program. The correspondence between in silico settings and parameters from {ddRADseq} in vitro experiments was assessed to provide guidelines for the reliable performance of the software. ddradseqtools is cost-efficient in terms of execution time, and can be run on computers with standard {CPU} and {RAM} configuration.},

Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans ({BayeScan}, hapflk, {OutFLANK}, {sNMF}). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of {BayeScan} that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of {BayeScan} is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.},
