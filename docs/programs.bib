  abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

Because Pool-Seq provides genome-wide SNP frequency data, it is possible to use them for demographic inference and/or the identification of selective sweeps. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is designed to detect selective sweeps from pooled data by accounting for statistical challenges associated with Pool-Seq, namely sequencing errors and random sampling among chromosomes. This allows for an efficient use of the information: all base calls are included in the analysis, but the higher credibility of regions with higher coverage and base calls with better quality scores is accounted for. Computer simulations show that our method efficiently detects sweeps even at very low coverage (0.5x per chromosome). Indeed, the power of detecting sweeps is similar to what we could expect from sequences of individual chromosomes. Since the inference of selective sweeps is based on the allele frequency spectrum (AFS), we also provide a method to accurately estimate the AFS provided that the quality scores for the sequence reads are reliable. Applying our approach to Pool-Seq data from Drosophila melanogaster, we identify several selective sweep signatures on chromosome X that include some previously well-characterized sweeps like the wapl region.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The goal of any parentage analysis is to identify as many parent-offspring relationships as possible, while minimizing incorrect assignments. Existing methods can achieve these ends, but they require additional information in the form of demographic data, thousands of markers and/or estimates of genotyping error rates. For many non-model systems, it is simply not practical, cost-effective or logistically feasible to obtain this information. Here, we develop a Bayesian parentage method that only requires the sampled genotypes to account for genotyping error, missing data and false matches. Results: Extensive testing with microsatellite and SNP datasets reveals that our Bayesian parentage method reliably controls for the number of false assignments, irrespective of the genotyping error rate. When the number of loci is limiting, our approach maximizes the number of correct assignments by accounting for the frequencies of shared alleles. Comparisons with exclusion and likelihood-based methods on an empirical salmon dataset revealed that our Bayesian method had the highest ratio of correct to incorrect assignments. Availability: Our program SOLOMON is available as an R package from the CRAN website. SOLOMON comes with a fully functional graphical user interface, requiring no user knowledge about the R programming environment. In addition to performing Bayesian parentage analysis, SOLOMON includes Mendelian exclusion and a priori power analysis modules.

  abstract = {Author Summary Eukaryotic genomes range from millions to billions of base pairs in size, but for many genetic experiments it is sufficient to gather information from just a fraction of these sites. In practice, selecting a consistent set of sites can be achieved by cutting genomic DNA with enzymes that recognize DNA sequence motifs, and then sequencing the ends of the resulting fragments. The advantages of this well-known approach are its low cost relative to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and that it does not require a sequenced genome. These methods, for example genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), are popular for mapping genes and studying population genetics, particularly in non-model organisms. Here we demonstrate, however, that computational tools designed for WGS are insufficient for handling certain error types that arise in GBS and other similar methods. We present a modified protocol for GBS and a statistical method for detecting these errors, implemented in the software package GBStools. We tested our methods on human DNA samples from Argentine populations. Our results reveal widely varying degrees of European and Native American ancestry, and that rare genetic variants are more numerous than would be expected in a population with constant size.},

  abstract = {Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of “standardized allele frequencies” that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools—a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from http://gcbias.org.},

Nevertheless, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming increasing popular in many areas of molecular ecology, owing to their high-throughput, easy transferability between laboratories and low genotyping error. An ongoing discussion concerns the relative power of SNPs compared to microsatellites—that is, how many SNP loci are needed to replace a panel of microsatellites? Here, we evaluate the assignment power of 80 SNPs (HE~=~0.30, 80 independent alleles) and 11 microsatellites (HE~=~0.85, 192 independent alleles) in a wild population of about 400 sockeye salmon with two commonly used software packages (Cervus3, Colony2) and, for SNPs only, a newly developed software (SNPPIT). Assignment success was higher for SNPs than for microsatellites, especially for parent pairs, irrespective of the method used. Colony2 assigned a larger proportion of offspring to at least one parent than the other methods, although Cervus and SNPPIT detected more parent pairs. Identification of full-sib groups without parental information from relatedness measures was possible using both marker systems, although explicit reconstruction of such groups in Colony2 was impossible for SNPs because of computation time. Our results confirm the applicability of SNPs for parentage analyses and refute the predictability of assignment success from the number of independent alleles.},

I present the r package sequoia, which assigns parents, clusters half-siblings sharing an unsampled parent and assigns grandparents to half-sibships. Assignments are made after consideration of the likelihoods of all possible first-, second- and third-degree relationships between the focal individuals, as well as the traditional alternative of being unrelated. This careful exploration of the local likelihood surface is implemented in a fast, heuristic hill-climbing algorithm. Distinction between the various categories of second-degree relatives is possible when likelihoods are calculated conditional on at least one parent of each focal individual. Performance was tested on simulated data sets with realistic genotyping error rate and missingness, based on three different large pedigrees (N~=~1000?2000). This included a complex pedigree with overlapping generations, occasional close inbreeding and some unknown birth years. Parentage assignment was highly accurate down to about 100 independent SNPs (error rate {$<$}0.1\%) and fast ({$<$}1~min) as most pairs can be excluded from being parent?offspring based on opposite homozygosity. For full pedigree reconstruction, 40\% of parents were assumed nongenotyped. Reconstruction resulted in low error rates ({$<$}0.3\%), high assignment rates ({$>$}99\%) in limited computation time (typically {$<$}1~h) when at least 200 independent SNPs were used. In three empirical data sets, relatedness estimated from the inferred pedigree was strongly correlated to genomic relatedness.},

  abstract = {Abstract Pedigrees, depicting genealogical relationships between individuals, are important in several research areas. Molecular markers allow inference of pedigrees in wild species where relationship information is impossible to collect by observation. Marker data are analysed statistically using methods based on Mendelian inheritance rules. There are numerous computer programs available to conduct pedigree analysis, but most software is inflexible, both in terms of assumptions and data requirements. Most methods only accommodate monogamous diploid species using codominant markers without genotyping error. In addition, most commonly used methods use pairwise comparisons rather than a full-pedigree likelihood approach, which considers the likelihood of the entire pedigree structure and allows the simultaneous inference of parentage and sibship. Here, we describe colony, a computer program implementing full-pedigree likelihood methods to simultaneously infer sibship and parentage among individuals using multilocus genotype data. colony can be used for both diploid and haplodiploid species; it can use dominant and codominant markers, and can accommodate, and estimate, genotyping error at each locus. In addition, colony can carry out these inferences for both monoecious and dioecious species. The program is available as a Microsoft Windows version, which includes a graphical user interface, and a Macintosh version, which uses an R-based interface.},

Here, we provide an updated guide for scientists interested in embarking on parentage analysis in natural or artificial populations of organisms, with a particular focus on computer software packages that implement various methods of analysis. Our survey of the literature shows that there are a few established methods that perform extremely well in the analysis of most types of parentage studies. However, particular experimental designs or study systems can benefit from some of the less well-known computer packages available. Overall, we find that parentage analysis is feasible and satisfying in most systems, and we try to provide a simple roadmap to help other scientists navigate the confusing topography of statistical techniques.},

  abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of “recent” paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

  abstract = {The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.},

  abstract = {Most components of an organism’s phenotype can be viewed as the expression of multiple traits. Many of these traits operate as complexes, where multiple subsidiary parts function and evolve together. As trait complexity increases, so does the challenge of describing complexity in intuitive, biologically meaningful ways. Traditional multivariate analyses ignore the phenomenon of individual complexity and provide relatively abstract representations of variation among individuals. We suggest adopting well-known diversity indices from community ecology to describe phenotypic complexity as the diversity of distinct subsidiary components of a trait. Using a hierarchical framework, we illustrate how total trait diversity can be partitioned into within-individual complexity (a diversity) and between-individual components (b diversity). This approach complements traditional multivariate analyses. The key innovations are (i) addition of individual complexity within the same framework as between-individual variation and (ii) a group-wise partitioning approach that complements traditional level-wise partitioning of diversity. The complexity-as-diversity approach has potential application in many fields, including physiological ecology, ecological and community genomics, and transcriptomics. We demonstrate the utility of this complexity-as-diversity approach with examples from chemical and microbial ecology. The examples illustrate biologically significant differences in complexity and diversity that standard analyses would not reveal.},

Apart from strong contributions of environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of courtship traits in founder\&\#x2010;flush and control populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each male and female display through the regression of the courtships involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the \&\#x201c;midparental\&\#x201d; courtship values of their parents. Overall, the average heritability was significantly ( \textbackslash documentclass\{aastex\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsbsy\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{bm\} \textbackslash usepackage\{mathrsfs\} \textbackslash usepackage\{pifont\} \textbackslash usepackage\{stmaryrd\} \textbackslash usepackage\{textcomp\} \textbackslash usepackage\{portland,xspace\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath,amsxtra\} \textbackslash usepackage[OT2,OT1]\{fontenc\} \textbackslash newcommand\textbackslash cyr\{ \textbackslash renewcommand\textbackslash rmdefault\{wncyr\} \textbackslash renewcommand\textbackslash sfdefault\{wncyss\} \textbackslash renewcommand\textbackslash encodingdefault\{OT2\} \textbackslash normalfont \textbackslash selectfont\} \textbackslash DeclareTextFontCommand\{\textbackslash textcyr\}\{\textbackslash cyr\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash DeclareMathSizes\{10\}\{9\}\{7\}\{6\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash landscape \$P=.012\$ \textbackslash end\{document\} ) higher for the parent\&\#x2010;daughter assays than for the parent\&\#x2010;son assays. We attributed the low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype\&\#x2010;by\&\#x2010;environment interactions whereby the male\&\#x2019;s behavior is influenced by the \&\#x201c;environment\&\#x201d; of his mating partner\&\#x2019;s preferences for the display, generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover, bottlenecked lines had up to 800\% of the heritability of the controls, suggesting \&\#x201c;conversion\&\#x201d; of additive genetic variance from nonadditive components. Second, we used line\&\#x2010;cross assays on separate populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of 0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64\% of the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.},

We present ddradseqtools, a software package to help ddRADseq experimental design by (i) the generation of in silico double-digested fragments; (ii) the construction of modified ddRADseq libraries using adapters with either one or two indexes and degenerate base regions (DBRs) to quantify PCR duplicates; and (iii) the initial steps of the bioinformatics preprocessing of reads. ddradseqtools generates single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE) reads that may bear SNPs and/or indels.

The resulting output files can be submitted to pipelines of alignment and variant calling, to allow the fine-tuning of parameters.

Knowledge about the genetic characteristics and relationships among these Ugandan goat breeds and the potential admixture with Boer goats is still limited. Using a medium‐density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel, we assessed the genetic diversity, population structure and admixture in six goat breeds in Uganda: Boer, Karamojong, Kigezi, Mubende, Small East African and Sebei. All the animals had genotypes for about 46~105 SNPs after quality control. We found high proportions of polymorphic SNPs ranging from 0.885 (Kigezi) to 0.928 (Sebei). The overall mean observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosity across breeds was 0.355~±~0.147 and 0.384~±~0.143 respectively. Principal components, genetic distances and admixture analyses revealed weak population sub‐structuring among the breeds. Principal components separated Kigezi and weakly Small East African from other indigenous goats. Sebei and Karamojong were tightly entangled together, whereas Mubende occupied a more central position with high admixture from all other local breeds. The Boer breed showed a unique cluster from the Ugandan indigenous goat breeds. The results reflect common ancestry but also some level of geographical differentiation. admixture and f4 statistics revealed gene flow from Boer and varying levels of genetic admixture among the breeds. Generally, moderate to high levels of genetic variability were observed. Our findings provide useful insights into maintaining genetic diversity and designing appropriate breeding programs to exploit within‐breed diversity and heterozygote advantage in crossbreeding schemes.},

  abstract = {Background Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program’s algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution. Results Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program. Conclusions Based on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly.},

  abstract = {The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining complete intra-specific genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep theory, beneficial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the last decade, a plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well as to resume long-running analyses after processor failures. In addition, the user can specify various demographic models via the command-line to calculate their theoretically expected site frequency spectra. Therefore, (in contrast to SweepFinder) the neutral site frequencies can optionally be directly calculated from a given demographic model. We show that an increase of sample size results in more precise detection of positive selection. Thus, the ability to analyze substantially larger sample sizes by using SweeD leads to more accurate sweep detection. We validate SweeD via simulations and by scanning the first chromosome from the 1000 human Genomes project for selective sweeps. We compare SweeD results with results from a linkage-disequilibrium-based approach and identify common outliers.},

We also focused on the significance of some implementations embedded in algorithm of each tool. Based on 10 simulated trees of different number of taxa generated by R, 400 known alignments and sequence files were constructed using indel-Seq-Gen. A total of 4000 test alignments were generated to study the effect of sequence length, indel size, deletion rate, and insertion rate. Results showed that alignment quality was highly dependent on the number of deletions and insertions in the sequences and that the sequence length and indel size had a weaker effect. Overall, ProbCons was consistently on the top of list of the evaluated MSA tools. SATe, being little less accurate, was 529.10\% faster than ProbCons and 236.72\% faster than MAFFT(L-INS-i). Among other tools, Kalign and MUSCLE achieved the highest sum of pairs. We also considered BALiBASE benchmark datasets and the results relative to BAliBASE- and indel-Seq-Gen-generated alignments were consistent in the most cases.},

  abstract = {Author Summary With modern genotyping technology, it is now possible to obtain large amounts of genetic data from many populations in a species. An important question that can be addressed with these data is: what is the history of these populations? There is a long history in population genetics of inferring the relationships among populations as a bifurcating tree, analogous to phylogenetic trees for representing the evolution of species. However, it has long been recognized that, since populations from the same species exchange genes, simple bifurcating trees may be an incorrect representation of population histories. We have developed a method to address this issue, using a model which allows for both population splits and gene flow. In application to humans, we show that we are able to identify a number of both previously known and unknown episodes of gene flow in history, including gene flow into Cambodia of a population only distantly related to modern East Asia. In application to dogs, we show that the boxer and basenji breeds have a considerable component of ancestry from grey wolves subsequent to domestication.},

  abstract = {India has been underrepresented in genome-wide surveys of human variation. We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the ‘Ancestral North Indians’ (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the ‘Ancestral South Indians’ (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39–71\% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically.},

Target capture sequencing offers an opportunity to increase sequencing coverage with little missing data and consistent orthologous loci across samples, although this approach has generally been applied to conserved markers for deeper evolutionary questions. Here, we combine both methods to generate high quality sequencing data for population genomic studies of all marine lobster species from the genus Jasus. We designed probes based on ddRADseq libraries of two lobster species (Jasus edwardsii and Sagmariasus verreauxi) and evaluated the captured sequencing data in five other Jasus species. We validated 4,465 polymorphic loci amongst these species using a cost effective sequencing protocol, of which 1,730 were recovered from all species, and 4,026 were present in at least three~species. The method was also successfully applied to DNA samples obtained from museum specimens. This data will be further used to assess spatial-temporal genetic variation in Jasus species found in the Southern Hemisphere.},

The original version (POPTREE) was a command-line program that runs on the Command Prompt of Windows and Unix. In POPTREE2 genetic distances (measures of the extent of genetic differentiation between populations) for constructing phylogenetic trees, average heterozygosities (H) (a measure of genetic variation within populations) and G(ST) (a measure of genetic differentiation of subdivided populations) are computed through a simple and intuitive Windows interface. It will facilitate statistical analyses of polymorphism data for researchers in many different fields. POPTREE2 is available at http://www.med.kagawa-u.ac.jp/∼genomelb/takezaki/poptree2/index.html.},

  abstract = {The Illumina DNA sequencing platform generates accurate but short reads, which can be used to produce accurate but fragmented genome assemblies. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate “hybrid” assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are low. Unicycler is open source (GPLv3) and available at github.com/rrwick/Unicycler.},

The program maps and aligns a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements, and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon identification with statistical significance testing. RESULTS: On a set of human messenger RNAs with random mutations at a 1 and 3\% rate, GMAP identified all splice sites accurately in over 99.3\% of the sequences, which was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set of human expressed sequence tags, GMAP provided higher-quality alignments more often than blat did. On a set of Arabidopsis cDNAs, GMAP performed comparably with GeneSeqer. In these experiments, GMAP demonstrated a several-fold increase in speed over existing programs.

  abstract = {Abstract Microsatellite markers have demonstrated their value for performing paternity exclusion and hence exploring mating patterns in plants and animals. Methodology is well established for diploid species, and several software packages exist for elucidating paternity in diploids; however, these issues are not so readily addressed in polyploids due to the increased complexity of the exclusion problem and a lack of available software. We introduce polypatex, an r package for paternity exclusion analysis using microsatellite data in autopolyploid, monoecious or dioecious/bisexual species with a ploidy of 4n, 6n or 8n. Given marker data for a set of offspring, their mothers and a set of candidate fathers, polypatex uses allele matching to exclude candidates whose marker alleles are incompatible with the alleles in each offspring?mother pair. polypatex can analyse marker data sets in which allele copy numbers are known (genotype data) or unknown (allelic phenotype data) ? for data sets in which allele copy numbers are unknown, comparisons are made taking into account all possible genotypes that could arise from the compared allele sets. polypatex is a software tool that provides population geneticists with the ability to investigate the mating patterns of autopolyploids using paternity exclusion analysis on data from codominant markers having multiple alleles per locus.},
